# PDA-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
## About the Project
This project aims to use deep learning technologies for the task of detecting Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA), a congenital heart defect, in the echocardiograms of infants. The dataset of infant echocardiograms was provided by the Children's Hospital of Orange County (CHOC) and the project was worked on by a team of 4 in conjunction with CHOC. This is the second iteration of this specific project and the purpose is to achieve better performance, i.e. higher accuracy, sensitivity, etc..., than the previous iteration done by CHOC. Multiple convolutional neural networks were selected due to their high performance on other classification tasks using medical data and were trained using transfer learning on the echocardiograms. In particular, MobileNet-V2, EFficientNet B0, EfficientNet B3, and MobileNASNET were picked.
